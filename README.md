# Py3ClassicSnake
A simple clone of the classic 2D top-down snake game in Python 3 using pygame.

[control.py](https://github.com/DataGhost4B3/Py3ClassicSnake/blob/main/control.py) is the main file. You need the pygame and tkinter libraries to run it.

[main.py](https://github.com/DataGhost4B3/Py3ClassicSnake/blob/main/main.py), [o1.py](https://github.com/DataGhost4B3/Py3ClassicSnake/blob/main/o1.py) and [textsnake.py](https://github.com/DataGhost4B3/Py3ClassicSnake/blob/main/) were initial prototyping efforts which went down horribly.

[start.ps1](https://github.com/DataGhost4B3/Py3ClassicSnake/blob/main/start.ps1) was an automating effort I undertook using PowerShell, for people not familar with Python and programming in general. It'd have "installed" the file. That is, once you run it, it'll download and install the latest version of Python on your PC then install the required libraries to run the game and then actually letting you play it. That was what I intended but it all went terribly wrong when I got to know you can't bypass the UAC with PowerShell automation. :(
